# hello-world

Hi minions,

I'm a 20 year old female majoring in Psychology.
I am in my junior year and I have a wide variety of interests.
I like play sports and video games.
I love to read, write, and draw.
And I basically want to laern eveyrthing and establish a wide variety of skill sets for myself.
I thorougly believe that sex is what makes life worth living and is the only thing that keeps me going (it's my drug).
